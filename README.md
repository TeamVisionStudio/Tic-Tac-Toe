## Game Logic Overview

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns marking a square with either X or O.

  - Rows, columns, or diagonals with the same mark.
- If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- The game can be reset at any time using the restart button.
